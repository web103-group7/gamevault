## About

### Description and Purpose

GameVault is a full-stack web app that allows users to track and organize inventory items from any video game in one place. Users can create games, add and manage items, and build custom loadouts or collections using gear from different games. The purpose of the app is to help players and collectors keep their inventories organized, compare their gear, and manage builds more easily across multiple titles.

### Inspiration

We were inspired by how many games have large and complex inventory systems, but most tools only support one game at a time or focus on full game libraries instead of item management. We wanted to build a flexible inventory tracker that works for any type of game, including RPGs, shooters, and collection-based games. We also drew inspiration from common inventory system ideas such as sorting, filtering, and detailed item organization, which are frequently discussed as core features of strong inventory experiences.

### Filters and Sorting

Users can filter items by game, type, and rarity, and sort them by name, power, or date added to find items more quickly.

### Starter Inventory Generator

When a user creates a new game entry, the app automatically generates a small starter inventory so the user begins with example content instead of an empty page.

### Inventory Detail Modal

Users can click on an item to open a modal that displays more details and allows quick edits without leaving the current page.

### Item Validation

The app validates user input before saving item data, such as requiring an item name and preventing invalid quantities or stat values from being stored.

### Error Handling

The app gracefully handles errors by showing user-friendly feedback when actions fail, forms are invalid, or requested data cannot be loaded.
